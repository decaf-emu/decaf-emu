- or at #wiiu-emu on freenode.

## Requirements
- Windows with the latest update of Visual Studio 2017
- Linux with a modern C++17 friendly compiler
- 64 bit
- CMake v3.2+
- Vulkan 1.1.106.0+

## Support
- None, this is an in-development project and user support is not provided.

## Binaries
The latest Windows binaries are available via [Actions artifacts](https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu/actions).

## Running

`./decaf-sdl play <path to game>`

It is recommended to run the emulator from the root git directory so that it is able to access `resources/fonts/*`.  Alternatively, set `resources_path` in the configuration file to point to the resources directory.

Configuration files can be found at:
- Windows - `%APPDATA%\decaf`
- Linux - `~/.config/decaf`

On Linux, a "Bus error" crash usually indicates an out-of-space error in the temporary directory.  Set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a directory on a filesystem with at least 2GB free.
